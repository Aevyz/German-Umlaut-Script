# [Archived] German Umlaut Script

### What is this?
This project aims to improve the quality of life of people who are using a QWERTY keyboard but require the features of a German QWERTZ keyboard, specifically:

* "ä"
* "ö"
* "ü"
* "ß"
* "„"

It seeks to improve ck's original script from the [AHK forums](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/515-german-umlaute-convenience-script/). Probably the most notable addition is adding `„`, which could not be found in the old script
